Headphone Company Website
This project involves building a website for a headphone company. The objective is to create a responsive and visually appealing site that showcases the company's products and brand identity.

Project Setup
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on responsive design. The structure of the project files is as follows:

index.html: The main HTML file containing the webpage structure and content.
style.css: The CSS file responsible for styling the website's elements and layout.
script.js: The JavaScript file used for dynamic interactions and functionalities on the webpage.
Design Approach
The design approach for this project emphasizes a clean and modern aesthetic with a user-friendly interface. The website is structured to provide a clear and concise navigation experience for visitors. Key considerations include:

Responsive design: The website is designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Visual hierarchy: The website uses a clear visual hierarchy to guide users through the content, with important elements highlighted to draw attention.
Accessibility: The website is designed to be accessible to all users, with appropriate color contrast, font choices, and keyboard navigation.
Specific Considerations
Font choices: The project utilizes Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle fonts. These fonts were selected for their readability, legibility, and compatibility across multiple platforms.
Responsive design implementation: A media query was implemented in the CSS to switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less. This ensures that the website is optimized for viewing on smaller screens, with a clear layout and easy navigation.
Interactive elements: The website incorporates interactive elements such as hover effects on links and buttons. These interactive elements enhance the user experience and add visual interest.
